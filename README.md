# 📊 Sales Analytics Dashboard Project

![Project Banner](INSERT_YOUR_BANNER_IMAGE_PATH_HERE)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on the end-to-end development of a dynamic **Sales Performance Dashboard** using Tableau. The dashboard transforms raw sales data into actionable business insights through a structured design process, moving from initial requirements to a fully interactive user interface.

The final dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity**, while providing granular insights into Category performance and Trends over time.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

The project was executed in **4 distinct phases** to ensure design consistency and data accuracy.

### 🔹 Phase 1: Analyze Requirements & Design

The foundation of the dashboard began with understanding user needs and planning the layout.
* **Requirement Analysis:** Defined user stories and KPIs.
* **Mockups:** Created low-fidelity sketches (wireframes) to visualize the arrangement of charts and KPIs.
* **Design Choices:** Selected the appropriate chart types (Line, Bar, Donut) and color palettes to effectively communicate the data.

### 🔹 Phase 2: Data Preparation & Modeling

Before visualization, the data was structured for optimal performance.
* **Data Connection:** Connected Tableau to the raw data source.
* **Data Modeling:** Created relationships between tables (Orders, Customers, Products) to form a robust data model.
* **Data Hygiene:** Renamed fields, checked data types, and verified data integrity before analysis.

### 🔹 Phase 3: Building Charts & Analytics

In this phase, individual visualizations were constructed to answer specific business questions.
* **Calculations:** Created Calculated Fields to derive new metrics like Profit Margins and Year-over-Year growth.
* **Visualizations:** Built core charts including "Sales vs Profit" trends and "Sales by Category" breakdowns.
* **Formatting:** Cleaned up axes, removed unnecessary grid lines, and added dynamic tooltips for a better user experience.

### 🔹 Phase 4: Dashboard Assembly & Layout

The final phase brought all components together into a cohesive interface.
* **Container Structure:** Utilized Vertical and Horizontal containers to ensure precise alignment of objects.
* **Assembly:** Arranged KPIs (BANs) and charts into the layout grid according to the mockup.
* **Interactivity:** Added filters, icons, and navigation elements to make the dashboard dynamic.
* **Refinement:** Adjusted padding and spacing to ensure a professional look.
